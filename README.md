# bpmn-anti-patterns-process-models

This repository holds process models of BPMN Anti-patterns based on Rozman et al. (2008).

These are the anti-patterns we were able to model through one of the selected BPMN-based process modeling tools (Bizagi, Bonita, Camunda and Signavio). The only anti-pattern we could not model were anti-pattern 5. The table below presents the anti-pattern id and its respective description.
